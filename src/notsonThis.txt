//this.title=title;//this.title is the global variable,and title is local variable
        title=filmtitle;//this is similar to this.title=filmtitle,but using this. prefix is not compulsory
        director=filmdirector;//this is similar to this.director=filmdirector,but using this. prefix is not compulsory
        //As there are no local variables by name title,or director so here they will implicitly referred to global variable
        //   so,here they will implicitly referred to global variable
        //note:if title and director are not globally declared then it will be undeclared varaible annot be resolved
        //If the parameter names are similar to the global variables
        //then there is an ambiguity between a local variable (parameters)and global variables
        //hence this. prefix is used for referring the global variable.
        //title=title will be referring the local variable on both sides of the = operator(self assigning)
